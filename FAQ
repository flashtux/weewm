1.1  I can't compile WeeWM stable version

  Please contact immediately authors!


1.2  I can't compile WeeWM CVS

  Check that you have latest version of autoconf and automake.
  WeeWM has been developed with autoconf version 2.56 and automake version 1.7.
  You should have at least these versions in order to compile WeeWM CVS.
  If you can't or don't want to install these versions, you can download and
  install "devel package", a package built almost every day, based on CVS.
  Note that this package may not correspond exactly to CVS base.

2.1  Why using WeeWM ? There are hundred of Window Managers for Xfree !

  Because WeeWM is very light and has new features.
  Some features:
    * smart windows placement
    * doc management
    * virtual desktops
    * light windows decoration
    * solid windows drags
    * config file for bindings
    * all can be done with keyboard
    * one key for many commands
    * small binary size
    * 100% GPL and free


2.2  I've launched WeeWM, but I'm lost, what can I do?

  Read documentation & ~/.weewm/keys.rc for default key bindings
  (for example Windows-Enter launch a terminal if X is properly configured for
   Windows meta key)


2.3  How can I customize key bindings?

  You can edit ~/.weewm/keys.rc file.
  You have to restart WeeWM to change keyboard config (this will be fixed in a
  future version).
